# This is a simple cron job to serve as an autobuild trigger.
# This is meant to run as a cron job every five minutes, and
# will trigger the build system based on a trigger file.
# If the trigger file contains a list of routers, it will
# run that list. Otherwise, it will trigger a full catalog
# build.

# Added 7/19/21: sequence number output. The trigger script
# will redirect all stdout and stderr into a text file with
# the sequence number, and pass that sequence number to the
# build script for use in error files.

######
#
# IMPORTANT: you MUST edit the following line to point to the
# config file you want to use for this instance of the script.
#
source ~/.config/autobuild19/autobuild19.conf
# source /serve/rooter/autobuild/autobuild19.conf
