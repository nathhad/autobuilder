# This is the config file to be sourced for the Rooter Autobuilder script.
# The user needs to tailor the config for their actual build environment
# and installed locations. This conf file also simplifies running
# multiple separate instances of autobuilder.

##########
#
# IMPORTANT!
#
# This autobuild system has now been reconfigured with use in the
# docker-rooterbuilder build systems as its main target. To greatly
# simplify reliability and maintenance, it has been rearranged to
# expect to live entirely in a file system location at
# /build/autobuild/ and will look for all of its files there. If
# you are installing in an alternate location, you will need to either
# edit the system to the location of your choice, or (simpler, if you're
# not picky) create a symlink at /build/autobuild that points to the folder
# where you actually plan to install. Note that all files in the system
# go looking for this folder, so if you choose to edit, you need to edit
# the line at the start of every script that pulls up this conf file.
#
#########

# It is also no longer recommended you directly edit this autobuild19.conf
# file, as it can be overwritten when using git pull to update the build
# system. Instead, copy it to autobuild.local.conf and make any changes
# required in that file. It will be run after this default config file,
# and will overwrite any variables you have changed. Optionally,
# autobuild19.local.conf may be an otherwise blank file containing
# only the overrides.
