# This is a full autobuild wrapper script for DM's ROOter
# build script system. It assumes an already installed
# and working 19076 build environment.

# It will handle updating the build environment, and
# then work its way through a build of all the
# standard images. It also includes a lockfile
# system to ensure that two instances don't
# run at once. This lockfile is trapped so that
# it still gets removed if the script exits
# unexpectedly.

# A list of images to build can be included as parameters;
# otherwise the script will pull the list of all
# available images from alllist.txt and build all.

# The following variables can be changed to suit the
# arrangement of the build server, and to allow building
# from multiple build environments at a time. You should have
# one autobuild script per build environment.
